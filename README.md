# Room 4 Python Assignment 1

A comprehensive Python basics assignment covering fundamental programming concepts including variables, user input, operators, control flow, loops, data structures, and functions.

## 📋 Assignment Overview

This project contains 30 exercises organized into 8 sections, designed to build foundational Python programming skills. Each section focuses on specific concepts and progressively increases in complexity.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand Python variables and data types
- Handle user input and output
- Implement conditional logic and operators
- Work with control flow (if/else statements)
- Master loop structures (for and while loops)
- Manipulate data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)
- Create and use functions

## 📚 Assignment Sections

### Section A: Basics & Variables (Questions 1-5)
- Variable creation and assignment
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication, division)
- Print statements

### Section B: User Input (Questions 6-8)
- Collecting user input
- Type conversion
- String concatenation
- Basic calculations with user data

### Section C: Operators & Logic (Questions 9-12)
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Boolean expressions
- Modulo operator for even/odd checking

### Section D: If/Else Statements (Questions 13-16)
- Conditional logic
- Age verification
- Password validation
- Positive/negative number checking

### Section E: Loops (Questions 17-20)
- For loops with range
- While loops
- Loop iteration
- Filtering with conditionals inside loops

### Section F: Data Structures (Questions 21-28)
- Lists: creation, indexing, appending, iteration
- Tuples: immutable sequences
- Sets: handling duplicates
- Dictionaries: key-value pairs and data access

### Section G: Functions (Questions 29-30)
- Function definition and calling
- Parameters and return values
- Function reusability

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- A code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, or any text editor)
- Basic command line knowledge

### Running the Code

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

2. Run the Python file:
```bash
python "Room 4 Python Assignment 1.py"
```

3. Follow the prompts for interactive exercises that require user input

## 💡 Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Variables**: Storing and manipulating data
- **Data Types**: Integers, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
- **Input/Output**: `input()` and `print()` functions
- **Type Conversion**: `int()`, `str()` for data type changes
- **Operators**: Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), comparison (`>`, `<`, `==`), logical (`and`, `or`)
- **Control Flow**: `if`, `elif`, `else` statements
- **Loops**: `for` and `while` loops with `range()`
- **Functions**: Defining reusable code blocks with `def`

## 📝 Example Exercises

**Variable Assignment:**
```python
age = 34
print(age)
```

**User Input with Validation:**
```python
password = input('enter your password ')
if password == 'python123':
    print('yes password is correct')
else:
    print('no password is not correct')
```

**Loop Iteration:**
```python
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
```
